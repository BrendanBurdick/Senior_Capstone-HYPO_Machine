# Senior_Capstone-HYPO_Machine

The senior capstone project is used to tie together key concepts that are learned while studying CS concepts at Framingham State University. The capstone required us to call on Computer Architecture, Programming, and Data Structures concepts.

For our project, we had to create a HYPO Machine and MTOPS Operating System. This was written in C++. The goal was to simulate how concurrent processes run on a computer and how the operating system manages them. The HYPO machine simulates the hardware components of a typical PC, including memory (RAM, MBR, MAR, GPRs, IR, etc) and CPU.
